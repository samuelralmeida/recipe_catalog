# VÃ³isa Recipes

We must develop without losing traditions. One of the most important to
maintain are the grandmother's culinary recipes. This app allows you to record
these recipes for eternity, in addition to knowing the recipes of other
grandparents around the world.

## Features

## How to contribute

### Bugs
The size limit of image to upload is 2MB. But when user try to upload a file
larger then 2MB an error is answered, but is not handled in the backend to not
break the application.

### Improvements
1. Each recipe is limited to 5 ingredients. It would be better if the user could
add as many ingredients as he wanted.

2. Create a function to edit image file name when upload to not have files with duplicate names

## Observation
The entire application is programmed in Python using Flask framework. The
database is SQLite and the CRUD functions use SQLAlchemy.
